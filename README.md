# Project-4-App

# House Plant App (better name to come...)

Bottom line the goal of this app is to save plants lives, or just to make the users life a little easier.
For those without a green thumb or just those that are too busy, the House Plant App will help a user keep track of various plants a user has by adding plans to a profile that assigns plants by category to a recommended water interval and notifies a user by by text or email when to water their plants.

In the future this app could be expanded to:

- Help a user diagnose plant ailments and issues.

- Suggest like plants to add to a users home or garden and show nearest places to purchase plants.

- Include a feature for users to list plants in your neighborhood to sell, trade, or give away.


## App structure

On the index page a user will be able to view information about the app and it purpose.

For complete functionality a user will need to create an account and log in(possibly with Oauth). Then the user would have a "myPlant" dashboard that a user can add plants to. The user will need to select a category for the plant they enter. Then the app will assign it to a watering interval based on the users input.
In the account creation a user will be prompted to choose a notification preference. The app will notify a user according to the notification preferences and the watering schedule.

A user will be able to create, update and delete.
